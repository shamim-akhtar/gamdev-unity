In this tutorial, we will explore how we can create and manipulate primitive shapes in Unity to create a more complex model.

We will use Unity’s built-in primitive shapes to construct something more intricate: a complex model. What exactly do we mean by a “complex model”? 

Essentially, it is a brand-new 3D object obtained by piecing together various primitive shapes like cubes, cylinders, spheres, and more. Rather than starting from scratch with a single detailed model, we are leveraging Unity’s primitives to build something unique, layer by layer.

Picture it like assembling a puzzle. Instead of having all the pieces neatly cut into a single shape, we are working with a diverse set of building blocks, each with its own properties and dimensions. By combining these primitives strategically, we can create complex structures that wouldn’t be feasible to construct manually.

We do so by applying the model-to-world transformation to these individual primitives. This transformation allows us to manipulate the position, the rotation, and the scale of each primitive, effectively placing them within our scene and moulding them into the desired form.

Through this exercise, you will gain hands-on experience with Unity’s modelling capabilities, honing your skills in applying transformations to create complex 3D models.

In this tutorial, we will build the 8-Puzzle game and integrate A-Star pathfinding to solve it. This tutorial is divided into three sections. 
First, we will focus on implementing the 8 puzzle game functionality, emphasising the programming aspects over design elements. 
Next, we will delve into implementing our pathfinding algorithms, including A-Star, Dijkstra's, and Greedy Best-First Search.
Finally, we will apply these pathfinding algorithms to solve various configurations of the 8-Puzzle.
