In this tutorial, we will build the 8-Puzzle game and integrate A-Star pathfinding to solve it. This tutorial is divided into three sections. 
First, we will focus on implementing the 8 puzzle game functionality, emphasising the programming aspects over design elements. 
Next, we will delve into implementing our pathfinding algorithms, including A-Star, Dijkstra's, and Greedy Best-First Search.
Finally, we will apply these pathfinding algorithms to solve various configurations of the 8-Puzzle.
